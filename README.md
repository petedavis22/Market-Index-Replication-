# Market-Index-Replication
In this project, I worked with a group of 5 to replicate the DJIA and SP500 portfolios. In our analysis, we utilized the Wharton Database (WRDS) to pull stock data. We were able to generate an annual return of 14.53% for SP500 replication, outperforming actual SP500, SPY, and VFIAX Mutual Fund.
