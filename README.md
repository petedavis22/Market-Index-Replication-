# Market-Index-Replication
In this project, I worked with a group of 5 to replicate the DJIA and SP500 portfolios in python. In our analysis, we utilized the Wharton Database (WRDS) to pull stock data. We were able to generate an annual return of 14.53% for SP500 replication, outperforming actual SP500, SPY, and VFIAX Mutual Fund.

Our one page final report is under the file name 'HW 1 Index Replication.pdf'. 

Our code is under the final name 'Investment Theory - Homework 1.ipynb'.
